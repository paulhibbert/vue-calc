# vue-calc

A simple calculator using Vue JS version 2 options API, originally written in July 2018.

It is very simple, just a learning exercise, and has no dependencies other than Vue JS.

Icons are mostly from [feathericons](https://feathericons.com/).

Updated Feb 2026 to use a parser written by Copilot rather than the dreaded eval function.
